#MSAL Integration with React
This repository contains a comprehensive solution for integrating Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) with a React application. The provided code demonstrates how to implement secure user authentication and authorization using MSAL, enabling seamless interaction with Microsoft services like Azure Active Directory.

#Features
Step-by-step setup and configuration of MSAL in a React app
Sample authentication flow with login and logout functionality
Handling of access tokens and secure API calls
Best practices for managing authentication state in React
Fetch and display user profile information (name, email, job title, etc.)
Retrieve and display user emails and calendar events from Microsoft Graph API
Access and show recent files from OneDrive
Getting Started
To get started, follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

#Prerequisites
Node.js (v14.x or later)
npm (v6.x or later) or yarn (v1.x or later)
An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sanjayprasadF5/msal-with-react.git
cd msal-with-react
Install dependencies:

sh
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn install

#Configuration
1. Register an application in Azure AD:
2. Go to the Azure Portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory.
3. Under "App registrations," click "New registration."
4. Enter a name for your application.
5. Add two platforms:
   Web platform: Set the redirect URI to the authentication server like https://login.microsoftonline.com/.auth/login/aad/callback
   Single-page application (SPA) platform: Set the redirect URI to http://localhost:3000 (your application's address).
6. After registration, note down the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID.

Configure the MSAL instance:
Create a src/authConfig.js file and configure your MSAL settings with your Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID.
Ensure your React application is wrapped with the necessary provider to handle MSAL.
Set up MSAL in your React app:
Wrap your React application with the MsalProvider in the src/index.js file.
Implement authentication in your React components, creating login and logout components using the provided hooks.

Running the App
Start the development server:

sh
Copy code
npm start
# or
yarn start
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.
