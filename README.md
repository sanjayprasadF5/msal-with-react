# MSAL Integration with React

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for integrating Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) with a React application. The provided code demonstrates how to implement secure user authentication and authorization using MSAL, enabling seamless interaction with Microsoft services like Azure Active Directory.

## Features

- Step-by-step setup and configuration of MSAL in a React app
- Sample authentication flow with login and logout functionality
- Handling of access tokens and secure API calls
- Best practices for managing authentication state in React

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later) or yarn (v1.x or later)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sanjayprasadF5/msal-with-react.git
   cd msal-with-react
   ```

npm install

# or

yarn install

Configuration
Register an application in Azure AD:

Go to the Azure Portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory.
Under App registrations, click New registration.
Enter a name for your application and set the redirect URI to http://localhost:3000.
After registration, note down the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID.
Configure the MSAL instance:

Create a src/authConfig.js file and configure your MSAL settings with your Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID.
Set up MSAL in your React app:

Wrap your React application with the MsalProvider in the src/index.js file.
Implement authentication in your React components:

Create login and logout components using the useMsal hook to handle authentication.
Running the App
Start the development server:

npm start

# or

yarn start

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.
